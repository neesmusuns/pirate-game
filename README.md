# pirate-game

This is a multiplayer browser game.

To run the program you'll need to run it in Intellij as a Maven project. Once the program is running, open a browser and connect to "localhost:8081".

If you want multiple players on the same server you can open up another browser (do not use the same one, or you'll end up with the identical session ID)
and connect. If you want to open it in another computer, use the local IP of the host computer.
