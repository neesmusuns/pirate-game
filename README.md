# pirate-game

This is a multiplayer Android game.

To run the program you'll need to run the root folder in Intellij as a Maven project. Once the program is running you'll want to run the 'AndroidProject/PirateGame' as an Android project in Android Studio.

In order to have an Android client connect to the correct server you'll have to:

1) find your local IP address (by using 'ipconfig' or an equivalent)
2) set the IP in RequestSender.java to your found local IP (the port should already be set)
3) launch the client

This edition misses the major features of shopping, sailing, and diving but we are approaching them at a stable rate.
